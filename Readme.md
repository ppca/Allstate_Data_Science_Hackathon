#Allstate Data Science Hackathon

#### This is a data science competition which resembles Kaggle. In the competition I used vehicle data and insurance information to predict the probability of a car having accident in the next year. 

#### In the project I first imputed missing values by random forest models using related features, one-hot-encode categorical features, then I classified whether a vehicle was injured by gradient boosted trees, and did grid search for optimized parameters.

#### The whole process is automated in the scripts/run.R, you can try it by running this script.
